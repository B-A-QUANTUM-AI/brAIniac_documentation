The Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital faces alot of challenges, one of them  being an extreme shortage of health practitioners (radiologists) in South Africa.
Those who are actively practicing tend to be overworked a lot,
and that alone could result in them making errors/mistakes when it comes to reading the MRI scans.

Brainiac.AI is an AI platform that will assist with minimizing the work load and errors/mistakes of
health practitioners (radiologists) by automatically analyzing MRI scans for early detection and classification of brain tumors.
It uses DL (Deep Learning) to classify the tumor types,
(IS) Image Segmentation to find the tumors' exact size and location, and Heatmaps to indicate the seriousness of the tumor.

This automated process enables precise classification and identification of tumors.
It provides health practitioners (radiologists) with a sense of comfort with it comes to the conclusion of MRI scans.
It also provides neurologists a less stress on identifying and removing of tumors.
