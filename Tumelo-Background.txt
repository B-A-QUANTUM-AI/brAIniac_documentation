South Africa faces alot of challenges, one of them  being an extreme shortage of health practitioners (radiologists).
Those who are actively practicing tend to be overworked a lot,
and that alone could result in them making errors/mistakes when it comes to reading the MRI scans.

The Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital falls victim to some of these challenges.

Quantum.AI, an AI focused company, saw the challenges and introduced a solution, Brainiac.AI.
Brainiac.AI is an AI platform that will assist with minimizing the work load and errors/mistakes of health practitioners (radiologists)
by automatically analyzing MRI scans for early detection and classification of brain tumors.
It uses DL (Deep Learning) to classify the tumor types

This automated process enables precise classification and identification of tumors.
It is a tool that offers health practitioners (radiologists and neurologists) greater confidence when interpreting the results of MRI scans.
