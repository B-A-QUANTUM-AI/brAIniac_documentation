Tools and techniques
1.	Python – the main development language due to its wide range of AI/ML libraries and strong community support
2.	Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques
•	Linear regression – for the numerical predictions like tumor size.
•	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – for tumor detection and classification from the MRI scans.
•	Image Segmentation Model (resNet) – for identifying tumor size and location.
•	Risk Assessment Algorithms – to assign the priority levels of the tumor(Low, Medium and High).
3.	Python Libraries
•	Pandas – for arranging and processing MRI metadata and patient file records
•	Numpy – for handling numerical operations.
•	Scikit-Learn – for ML tasks (classification, regression)
•	TensorFlow / PyTorch – for DL (CNNs and resNet)
4.	Development and collaboration Tools and Techniques
•	Face to face meetings – To discuss the work and brainstorm ideas
•	WhatsApp – for faster and ease of communications
•	Git and GitHub – version control, code collaboration and project management
•	Visual Studio Code – for development of brAIniac codebase
5.	Support Tools
•	Grammarly – for formatting documentation
•	MS Word – for generating documentation for brAIniac project
•	Notepad – for generating documentation on how to use brAIniac
•	Canva/Figma – for creating poster and presentation design
