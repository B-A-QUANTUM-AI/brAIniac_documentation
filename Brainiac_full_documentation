1. AI SOLUTION 
     The diagnosis of brain tumors is one of the most critical tasks in healthcare. Despite its significance, 
     it remains yet still a time consuming activity requiring lots of resources and expertise to move from 
     differentials to diagnosis. Medical practitioners often rely on manual inspection of MRI scans a process,
     which is prone to human errors even in developed countries. Our proposed solution leverages the BRISC 2025 
     dataset – a high quality, vetted dataset containing multiple MRI scans already vetted by experts in radiology 
     and neurology, to build a solution to assist and support healthcare in Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital for tumor detection
     and classification. The solution adopts deep learning for image classification to identify the
     type of brain tumor (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Adenomas or No Tumor) This AI solution also aligns with 
     South Africa’s goal of leveraging the power of AI technologies to create innovative ideas and solutions 
     in the healthcare industry. This will reduce diagnostic workload and provide for faster response from diagnosis
     to corrective actions for such a life threatening condition. 

2. BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
     • Improve brain tumor diagnostic accuracy (greater than 80%) using leveraging brisc2025 dataset
     • To Reduce the time required for diagnostic

         Aim for at least 80%+ accuracy when classifying brain MRI scans into the different categories: Healthy, Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary Adenoma.
    B.Time Efficiency 
         Process each scan and generate a full analysis report, including detection, classification, and visualization outputs, in under 5 minutes.
    C. Confidence Score
         The system must provide a confidence score (%) for each prediction


4. BUSINESS BACKGROUND
    South Africa faces alot of challenges, one of them  being an extreme shortage of health practitioners 
    (radiologists) (https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/01/14/south-africas-healthcare-crisis).
    Those who are actively practicing tend to be overworked a lot,and that alone could result in them making
    errors/mistakes when it comes to reading the MRI scans. The Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital falls victim 
    to some of these challenges.

    Quantum.AI, an AI focused company, saw the challenges and introduced a solution, Brainiac.AI.
    Brainiac.AI is an AI platform that will assist with minimizing the work load and errors/mistakes of health 
    practitioners (radiologists) by automatically analyzing MRI scans for early detection and classification of 
    brain tumors. It uses DL (Deep Learning) to classify the tumor types. This automated process enables precise 
    classification and identification of tumors. It is a tool that offers health practitioners (radiologists and neurologists) 
    greater confidence when interpreting the results of MRI scans.


5. REQUIREMENTS
A. Functional Requirements:
    •	Input MRI scans in digital format. 
    •	The system must normalize and preprocess images (e.g., resize, contrast adjustment, noise reduction).
    •	The system must predict tumors into one of four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Adenoma, or No Tumor.
    •	The system must generate a diagnostic report summarizing: tumor type, accuracy score    

B. Non-Functional Requirements:
    •	The system must handle at least 30 MRI scans per hour concurrently.
    •	The system must maintain consistent performance across different MRI scans-pictures.
    •	The system must support expansion to other hospitals in future.
    •	The system must be available 99.9% of the time.
    •	User-friendly dashboard for non-technical staff.
    •	Generate summary reports for radiologists.
 

6. CONSTRAINTS.
    The brAIniac system is limited to the analysis of MRI brain scans only.
    The brain tumor classification is restricted to Glioma, Meningioma,No tumor and Pituitary Adenoma only.
    The brAIniac will ensure transparency in reporting tumor detection, classification and risk assessment therefore the transparency in how risk levels are determined is non-negotiable.
    The system will not predict how long a patient will live
    

7. RISKS
   Risk: Missclassification due to MRI scans or poor-quality data - Inaccuracy. 
   Mitigation: Avoid data imbalance due to the AI not having enough data from each class used for classification
   Mitigation: Using Data Augmentation techniques (flips, zooms, and random rotations) to artificially expand the training datasetto ensure our model learns that tumors are the same, no matter their slight orientation or appearance. Rigorously training the AI for more accuracy.

   Risk: End user Over-reliance on AI 
   Mitigation: A transparent reporting system that includes a confidence score like “Glioma - 88%” and visualizations to prevent blind trust in uncertain predictions. 
   Mitigation: Clear non-negotiable disclaimers on all reports stating that the AI system is a Decision support tool and not meant to replace medical professionals. Final decisions need to be made by a qualified medical professional.

   Risk: Legal-Risk Data Privacy
   Mitigation: The system must comply with South Africa’s POPIA act healthcare data privacy regulations

   Risk: Lack of User Adoption
   Mitigation: Transparancy,How to use Document 

   Risk: Technical Failure
   Mitigation: Hosting the Ai solution on cloud services

9. Problem Definition:

     Diagnosing brain tumors with MRI scans is very important but takes a lot of time and resources. In South Africa and other developing areas, there aren’t enough radiologists,
     and the ones available are often overworked. This leads to mistakes and delays in treating patients. Looking at MRI scans by hand takes a long time, can lead to errors,
     and slows down treatment for serious conditions like Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary Adenomas.

     This issue is very important in healthcare because brain tumors still cause many deaths and serious health problems.
     Finding them early and accurately can greatly improve how well patients recover.
     The proposed solution uses the BRISC 2025 dataset and deep learning methods to automatically analyze and classify medical images, helping tackle this problem directly.
     This solution will help lower the amount of work for radiologists, improve accuracy, and make reporting faster.
     It’s designed to support doctors by helping them give quicker and more dependable diagnoses.
     It won’t take the place of medical professionals, but will act as a helpful tool so they can make better decisions with more confidence.
