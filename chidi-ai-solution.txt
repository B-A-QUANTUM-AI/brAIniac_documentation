1.	AI Solution (Relevance to theme and environment)
The diagnosis of brain tumors is one of the most critical tasks in healthcare. Despite its significance, it remains yet still a time consuming activity requiring lots of resources and expertise to move from differentials to diagnosis. Medical practitioners often rely on manual inspection of MRI scans a process, which is prone to human errors even in developed countries.
Our proposed solution leverages the BRISC 2025 dataset – a high quality, vetted dataset containing multiple MRI scans already vetted by experts in radiology and neurology, to build a solution to assist and support healthcare in developing countries for tumor detection and classification. The solution adopts deep learning for image segmentation and classification to identify the type of brain tumor (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Adenomas or No Tumor)
This AI solution also aligns with South Africa’s goal of leveraging the power of AI technologies to create innovative ideas and solutions in the healthcare industry. This will reduce diagnostic workload and provide for faster response from diagnosis to corrective actions for such a life threatening condition.
