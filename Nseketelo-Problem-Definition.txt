Problem Definition:

Diagnosing brain tumors with MRI scans is very important but takes a lot of time and resources.
In South Africa and other developing areas, there aren’t enough radiologists,
and the ones available are often overworked. This leads to mistakes and delays in treating patients.
Looking at MRI scans by hand takes a long time, can lead to errors, and slows down treatment for serious conditions like Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary Adenomas.

This issue is very important in healthcare because brain tumors still cause many deaths and serious health problems.
Finding them early and accurately can greatly improve how well patients recover.
The proposed solution uses the BRISC 2025 dataset and deep learning methods to automatically analyze and classify medical images, helping tackle this problem directly.
This solution will help lower the amount of work for radiologists, improve accuracy, and make reporting faster.
It’s designed to support doctors by helping them give quicker and more dependable diagnoses.
It won’t take the place of medical professionals, but will act as a helpful tool so they can make better decisions with more confidence.
