•	The system must analyze an MRI scan and generate results in under 5 minutes.
•	The system must handle at least 30 MRI scans per hour concurrently.
•	The system must maintain consistent performance across different MRI machine models.
•	The system must support expansion to other departments and hospitals in future.
•	The system must comply with South Africa’s POPIA healthcare data privacy regulations.
